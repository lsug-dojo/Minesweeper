Welcome to the London Scala user group dojo workspace hosted on assembla

https://www.assembla.com/spaces/lsug-dojo/

The main aim of the dojo is to help improve the experience and understandng
of the Scala language for all members of the user group.

Creating fully working software projects is not a goal of the dojo events,
however it should increase the number of members who are able to work on
Scala projects productively.

This workspace hosts the code created during the monthly dojo events and you
can browse the code or check out the code from the Source/Git page.

Any projects that will be carried out in the dojo events will be detailed on
the projects page of this wiki.
